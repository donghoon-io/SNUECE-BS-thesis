\subsection{Implementation}

AmslerTouch is implemented as a web application, targeted to both touch interaction and mouse click. I developed the program using Svelte~\cite{svelte}, a Javascript framework for developing a web application. After being developed, the program was deployed on Google Firebase and the source code later became available at GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/donghoon-io/AmslerTouch}.

While developing AmslerTouch, I utilized the following third-party libraries to enhance the usability of the system. All of these libraries are properly used under the license of each library:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Notus-svelte~\cite{notus-svelte}}: A theme for svelte web app. This library is used for designing an interface
    \item \textbf{React canvas draw~\cite{react-canvas-draw}}: A Javascript tool for drawing regions. I modified the library to draw a circle and fill the circle with Gaussian filter
\end{itemize}
